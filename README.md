LIRI Bot - Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

LIRI Bot Node Application Homework 

You can use LIRI Bot to help you get information about what is important to you!

Liri has a set of commands you can use your keyboard to execute. 

* Help you with getting basic info on a song with ___Spotify a Song___.
* Find where your favorit bands are playing live with ___Find Concerts___.
* Get the information you are dieing to know about a movie using ___Retrive Movie Info___.
* If you don't know what you want Liri can just give you random info using the ___Just Give Me Something___ command. 

Best part is that if you ever forget Liri stores all this valuable information in his log file. But don't worry if you rather him forget feel free to use the ___Clear Log___ command and he will just wipe his own memory. Bots can do that ya' know?
